#  Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages various machine learning and data science libraries in Python to build a classification model capable of predicting the presence of heart disease based on clinical and diagnostic patient data.

---

##  Problem Definition

**Can we accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes?**

Given a set of clinical features describing a patient (such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc.), the goal is to create a machine learning model that determines the likelihood of the presence of heart disease.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

* **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Heart Disease Dataset (Cleveland)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
* The dataset contains 14 attributes and a target variable indicating the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

##  Approach

1. **Problem Definition**
   Define the classification task: Predicting heart disease from clinical parameters.

2. **Data Exploration**
   Understand data structure, clean missing or inconsistent entries, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. **Feature Engineering**
   Convert categorical variables, scale features, and select relevant attributes.

4. **Model Building**
   Train various machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest) and evaluate performance.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

6. **Experimentation & Optimization**
   Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
